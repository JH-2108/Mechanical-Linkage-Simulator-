# Mechanical Linkage Simulator

A Python project that simulates and visualizes 2D mechanical linkages to explore the geometry of motion.  
This project combines coding, math, and mechanical design — showing how simple geometric relationships can create complex and beautiful motion.

## Purpose

I built this simulator to understand how linkages transform rotational motion into linear or oscillating motion — the same principles behind engines, robots, and suspension systems.  
By translating equations of motion into code, I wanted to visualize what engineers design every day: systems that turn *theory into movement.*

This project is part of my personal engineering exploration, inspired by my interest in mechanical systems, robotics, and aerodynamics.

## Features

- Simulates 2D linkages such as **four-bar** and **crank-slider** mechanisms  
- Adjustable **bar lengths** and **joint angles**  
- Real-time **animation** using Matplotlib  
- Displays **position**, **velocity**, and **displacement** over time  
- Optional data export for further analysis

## Concepts Behind It

Each linkage is modeled using basic trigonometry and the loop-closure equations of kinematics.  
By solving these equations, the simulator calculates how each link moves when a crank rotates, creating an interactive visualization of mechanical motion.
